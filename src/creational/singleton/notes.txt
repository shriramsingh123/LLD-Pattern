The singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance
 and provides a global access point to that instance. In other words, it guarantees that there is only
 one object of a particular class in your entire program, and there's a single way to access that object.

Here are some key points about the singleton design pattern:

*Core principles:
->Single instance: The class can only have one instance.
->Global access point: There's a single static method to access the instance.
->Private constructor: The constructor is private to prevent direct instantiation.


*Benefits:
->Enforces global state: Useful for managing global resources like configuration settings or logging systems.
->Reduces memory usage: By having only one instance, you save memory compared to creating multiple objects.
->Simplifies access: Provides a central point to access the object's functionality.


*Drawbacks:
->Tight coupling: Can make code less testable and harder to reason about.
->Anti-pattern potential: Overuse can lead to rigid and inflexible code.
->Threading issues: Requires careful handling in multithreaded environments.


*When to use it:
 ->When you need a single, globally accessible object.
 ->When managing resources like files, databases, or configuration settings.
 ->When simplifying access to complex functionality.


*When to avoid it:
 ->When there's no clear need for a single instance.
 ->When flexibility and testability are more important than global state.
 ->In multithreaded environments without proper handling.

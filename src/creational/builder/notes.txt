The Builder design pattern provides a step-by-step approach to constructing complex objects with numerous
 optional or configurable parameters. It separates the object creation process from its representation,
  offering several benefits:

*Key Characteristics:
 ->Builder class: Responsible for constructing the object step-by-step, often with fluent methods
        allowing chained calls.
 ->Mandatory vs. Optional parameters: Some parameters might be essential for object creation,
        while others are optional.
 ->Immutable intermediate state: The Builder object is usually immutable, ensuring the object
        is only built once in its final state.
 ->Method to obtain the final object: The Builder provides a method like build() to retrieve the
        constructed object.


*Benefits:
 ->Improved readability: Complex object creation becomes clearer and easier to follow.
 ->Flexibility: Allows setting optional parameters as needed.
 ->Immutability: Ensures final object integrity and simplifies testing.
 ->Reusability: The Builder can be reused to create different variations of the same object type.

*Drawbacks:
 ->Increased complexity: Introduces additional classes compared to direct construction.
 ->Overuse potential: Not necessary for simple objects with few parameters.
